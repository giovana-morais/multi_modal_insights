# multi_modal_insights

## how it works
We detect the modality of the data by analyzing file types

## how to use

Clone the repo, `cd` into it and install the module by running

`pip install -e .`

In the `notebooks` folder we have examples of description for each supported
modality.

## team behind it

We started this project as a final project for the Big Data course taught by
Prof. Juliana Freire at NYU Tandon.
