# multi_modal_insights

## how it works
We detect the modality of the data by analyzing file types

## how to use

Clone the repo, `cd` into it and install the module by running

`pip install -e .`

In the `notebooks` folder we have examples of description for each supported
modality.

## folder structure

* `src`: source code
* `notebooks`: examples of single-modality descriptions
* `slurm_jobs`: SLURM jobs to run the code on [HPC](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/home?authuser=0)

## team behind it

We started this project as a final project for the Big Data course taught by
Prof. Juliana Freire at NYU Tandon.
